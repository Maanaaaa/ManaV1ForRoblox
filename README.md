# ManaV1ForRoblox
Simple script for lvl 2 executors that doesn't have httpget function

Discontinued for some time (~1 week) for some reasons:
```
1. Gui library: it's very bad and it doesn't support mobile devices (emulators too)
2. Features: right now this script has ONLY 3 features and i'm working on other features
3. Perfomace: right now it's very bad because as i said this has ONLY 3 features + pc ONLY support

I'll be working on full script remake until next friday 
```
Already done features:
```
FovChanger
DayTime
NoAnimation
ClickTP
Gravity
CustomCrossHair
Better GuiLibrary + GuiLibrary Optimization (30%)
```
